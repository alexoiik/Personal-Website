# Personal-Website
My first Personal Webpasite, created from scratch with the environment of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This specific web page was a great practice, created for University's cource ''Web Languages and Technologies'' and describes few things about me and my interests, hobbies & studies. Open the webpage preferably via computer.
